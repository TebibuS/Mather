# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: Tebibu Kebede

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Summary

Mather is an android app that is a basic tip calculator app for Android, which allows users to calculate the tip and total amount based on the bill amount and the selected tip percentage.

The app has several basic components, including an EditText view for entering the bill amount, a SeekBar for selecting the tip percentage, and several TextViews for displaying the calculated tip amount and total amount.

The app uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where the MainActivity acts as the controller, and the various views (EditText, SeekBar, and TextViews) act as the views. The model component in this app is the calculation of the tip and total amount, which is done in the calculateTipAndTotalAmount function.

The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple example of how to create an Android app using Kotlin, and to introduce you to some of the basic components and concepts in Android development.

As for the stretch features, implementing ViewBinding is a recommended best practice in Android development to simplify and reduce boilerplate code when working with views. Adding an additional functionality, such as splitting the bill among multiple people, is a good way to extend the functionality of the app and make it more useful to users.
